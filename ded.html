                <h2>Chacal:</h2>
                <p>Characteristics: Chacal has a brown cloak covering its head and a little of the shoulders, along with a red band tied at the back of the hat. His torso is protected by a light and strong leather armor, with small details in shiny metal, and at his waist he carries one of his daggers. His pants are made of a black fabric that resembles leather straps interwoven with each other. And his boots are accompanied by shin pads made of tough bones.</p>
                <p>LORE: Goulthard was born in the small town of Nerubia in the kingdom of Theda, where he lived with his parents Dylon and Amalia. His mother ran a shop that sold all kinds of relics, jewelry and artifacts found by his father Dylon, who was the leader of the city's guild of archaeologists.</p>
                <p>His father was always too busy looking for answers to the mysteries he found in his explorations, spending months or even years away from home, so his physical presence during Goulthard's childhood and adolescence was short-lived. By not having his father's presence, Goulthard looked a lot on his mother, acquiring a sweet and charismatic personality, and by always witnessing his mother doing negotiations, he became skilled at dealing with other people and making deals.</p>
                <p>Dylon's influence on his son's life was limited to sending letters, notes and gifts. He constantly sent letters telling about his adventures and discoveries, praising how magnificent were the places and countries he visited, drawing maps and even risking some paintings to portray the places he passed.</p>
                <p>Through these letters, Goulthard got to know the world without leaving his home, always aiming to visit the places where his father had been, as well as cooperating with his writing and reading development, thus awakening his interest in history, archeology and magic books. In his mid-40s, almost into adolescence, Goulthard began to receive sporadically some incomprehensible maps and letters, written in a strange alphabet and accompanied by masked illustrations. His mother, witnessing this latent admiration that she nurtured for her father, always kept the notes and letters her husband sent, even the incomprehensible ones.</p>
                <p>Dylon Died when Goulthard was about 50 years old, bequeathing to his son all the research and records he made during his life, in addition to his personal notebook, a red feather, a dagger inlaid by a handful of Igneous Amethysts and a gray mask with black accents of an unknown material. This mask was the greatest archaeological find his father had discovered in his entire career. The research involving this mask and the secrets behind it took much of his life, as the evidence and legends about that type of artifact were extremely scarce. After many years of research Dylon managed to decipher most of the symbols and runes present in the place where he found the mask, thus deducing a possible location of a second mask similar to the one he had.</p>
                <p>After Dylon's death, his wife Amalia closed the artifacts shop and began to manage the agrarian and fishing production of the city, taking care of the logistics and sale of the products. Goulthard, after losing his father, declared to himself that he would continue his research and follow in his footsteps as an archaeologist. His personality, which was once extremely extroverted, became a mixture of seriousness and charisma (Neutral Good), but he never lost the affection he had with his mother. Gou continued to live with his mother until he was 100 years old, having left on his journey after that period.</p>
                <p>Initially Goulthard did not know very well where to start looking for an answer to the mystery left by his father or where to get them, as it was something that very few people knew, making everything more difficult and challenging. After 10 years of searching, on one of his nights staying in the capital Rosario, when he watched the mask left by his father trying to find out what material it was made of, he was tempted to put it on his face, thus, doing, but not feeling anything in the process. Dismayed at not being able to get any new information, Gou lay down on his bed and put the mask on his face to cover the few rays of light that came through his bedroom window. After falling asleep, Goulthard began to hear voices in his dream, initially small whispers but becoming clearer over time. Gou, aware that he was dreaming, heard the mysterious voice pronouncing his name.</p>
                <p>_Goulthard, I can make your wishes come true and grant you the necessary power and knowledge.</p>
                <p>_In exchange for a simple favor; meet my fellow men, thus I will satiate the incessant doubts that arise in your mortal mind.</p>
                <p>With great effort Gou tries to answer the mysterious voice.</p>
                <p>_...... Yes... anything to... fulfill my father's dream...</p>
                <p>_Don't regret your choice mate.</p>
                <p>After the first contact with the mask, 90 years passed, and Goulthard was 200 years old. He started using the mask frequently. With the help of his patron Goulthard started his journey on the path of witchcraft, acquiring power and knowledge with remarkable speed. Always subconsciously guided by his mask, Goulthard began to find answers to his doubts, the most latent being where the other mask his father mentioned in his notes would be located.</p>
                <p>After years and years of searching for the location of the mask, Goulthard explored every corner and every cave in the Spine of Kerock, but he was never successful in his search, he only found empty ruins and abandoned for millennia. Finding yourself 250 years old.</p>
                <p>On one of his trips in search of information in the city of Rosario, walking through the city's black market, Goulthard felt his mind shut down for a moment; regaining consciousness before falling to the ground. After a few minutes of what happened, Goulthard felt a strange disturbing aura coming from a pawnshop; after approaching slowly the store Gou came across numerous equipment, relics and old things. But only one thing caught his attention, a mask (MASK DESCRIPTION) that emanated an astonishing aura, but only Goulthard seemed to notice it. When asking the store owner about the mask, he replied that it was just an aesthetic or decorative item without much use. Without thinking twice, Gou bought the mask and returned to his quarters to analyze it.</p>
                <p>After studying the mask, Gou lay down to sleep and, in his dream, received the thanks of his patron for having found one of his peers, thus confirming that this mask could be the one that his father failed to find after years of search.</p>
                <p>Continuing his long and tiring journey, Goulthard began to think that it would be good to have an ally to help him in his relentless quest. At various times he realized how useful it would be to be in someone's company, both to solve problems and to solve his need for social interaction.</p>
                <p>So, as he walked through the streets of Rosario near the black market, he found a place that seemed to trade marked slaves. And wanting to get a reliable ally as soon as possible, he decided to take a look at the place.</p>
                <p>Upon entering the establishment he came across numerous different races trapped behind bars, the entire place was horrendous, dirty and poorly maintained, with the exception of some cells where you could see a certain level of comfort.</p>
                <p>The shop owner was a stout Orc with a look of superiority and kept staring at Gou the entire time. Goulthard, after looking at almost all the cells, felt a slight shiver as he approached the cell of a drow elf who was asleep in his bed. After some thought, Gou decided to choose the elf to be his loyal slave. The Orc immediately questions him about his choice, asking if he was sure he would take that drow, and with a straight answer he says he knows how to handle difficult things, so the owner asks him to wait at the entrance while preparing the pact to bind him. the elf.</p>
                <p>After seeing the Orc pushing the elf towards him and seeing her fall to her knees, he offers to help her up, and she accepts the help without resentment. After that he signs the agreement and takes her to the place where she was staying. Upon arriving at the place, he introduces himself removing his mask and revealing his nickname (Jackal) and then asking the elf's name. No response he says.</p>
                <p>_I just want your help and company, I won't do anything bad to you, you help me and I'll help you, whatever help you need.</p>
                <p>.................................... Eva, Evangelyne.</p>
